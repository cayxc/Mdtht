2. Replace ` ()=>{new Mdtht} ` as follows:

   1. Only modify the text font:` ()=>{(new Mdtht).modifyFont("Text Font")}`

   2. Only modify the code font:` ()=>{(new Mdtht).modifyFont("default", "code font")}`

   3. Modify text and code fonts:` ()=>{(new Mdtht).modifFont("Text Font", "Code Font")} `, the following is an example:

   ```javascript
   //1.Only modify the text font to: Times New Roman
   ()=>{(new Mdtht).modifyFont("Times New Roman")}
      
   //2.Only modify the code font to: Helvetica
   ()=>{(new Mdtht).modifyFont("default", "Helvetica")}
      
   //3.Change the text font to Times New Roman and the code font to: Helvetica
   ()=>{(new Mdtht).modifyFont("Times New Roman", "Helvetica")}
   ```
